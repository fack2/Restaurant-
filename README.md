# Restaurant:

We've created a website that shows the user several types of cuisines to choose
from, and when the user clicks on one of them, it shows a list of restaurants
that serve that type of cuisine, and it allows you to click on any resturant you
want and see a list of details about it, like the menu and the restaurant's
name.

## Website link:

## User journey:

- As a user I'm able to choose a cuisine.
- As a user I'm able to choose a restaurant from the list.
- As a user I should see some details about the restaurant I chose.
